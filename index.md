Hello! I am Perrida, a yesteryear avid book reader who lost her reading abilties in adulthood.
I am trying to slowly get back into reading regularly now. To make it more meaningful I wanted to share
some of my thoughts on some of the books I am reading.

I have been reading books for close to 25 years now. I have been writing reviews for close to 0 of them. Most of my reading evaporates from my brain as soon as I close the book. I want to organize my thoughts on my reads to help add meaning to the experience. Please note, this is my first foray into book reviewing and as such my opinions won't be well formed or well articulated, but rest assured they would be coherent (hopefully).

This will also force me to read some more classy books as opposed to some of my guilty pleasures (I am looking at you Ali Hazelwood). I tend to mix up my reads enough so that I don't get drained out from reading stuff that's too heavy.

I don't expect this blog will attract a lot of visitors and is mostly meant to be my personal journal for my reading journey. Nevertheless, if you do find it, do let me know your thoughts and also leave a book reccomendation for me (if you want).

Thank you for visiting, hope you will be back :)
